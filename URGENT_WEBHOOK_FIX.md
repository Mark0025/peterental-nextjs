## Verify It Works

1. **Open Vercel logs:**
   ```bash
   vercel logs --follow
   ```

2. **Test with new Google sign-in:**
   - Use incognito window
   - Go to your app
   - Sign in with a NEW Google account
   - Watch Vercel logs for:
     ```
     ðŸ”” Clerk webhook: user.created event received
     âœ… User created in database
     ```

3. **Check database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```
   Should show the new user with full_name populated

## What Was Fixed in Backend

âœ… `UserPublic.from_user()` - Auto-computes full_name from first_name + last_name
âœ… `create_from_clerk()` - Populates full_name on user creation
âœ… `update()` - Auto-updates full_name when names change
âœ… Existing user updated: "Mark Carpenter"

## What Was Fixed in Frontend

âœ… Added detailed webhook logging
âœ… Better error messages
âœ… Updated .env.example with all required variables
âœ… Created CLERK_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md guide
