# Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your Next.js app now has **Clerk authentication** fully integrated following the latest best practices!

## 🔧 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Package Installation**

- ✅ Installed `@clerk/nextjs@latest` (v6.33.7)

### 2. **Environment Variables**

- ✅ Added Clerk keys to `.env.local`:
  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
  ```

### 3. **Middleware Setup**

- ✅ Created `middleware.ts` with `clerkMiddleware()` (latest approach)
- ✅ Configured proper route matching for App Router

### 4. **Layout Integration**

- ✅ Wrapped app with `<ClerkProvider>` in `app/layout.tsx`
- ✅ Added `ProtectedRoute` component for authentication enforcement

### 5. **Navigation Updates**

- ✅ Added Sign In/Sign Up buttons for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Added UserButton for authenticated users
- ✅ Styled to match your app's design

### 6. **Protected Routes**

- ✅ All app content now requires authentication
- ✅ Beautiful sign-in prompt for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Loading states during authentication

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Get Your Clerk Keys**

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)
2. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**
3. Replace the placeholders in `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   ```

### 2. **Test the Authentication Flow**

1. Start your dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see the sign-in prompt
4. Click "Sign Up" to create an account
5. After signing in, you'll see the full app with your user button

### 3. **Customize Authentication (Optional)**

- **Sign-in/Sign-up pages**: Clerk provides hosted pages by default
- **Custom styling**: Modify the `appearance` prop in navigation components
- **User metadata**: Access user data with `useUser()` hook from `@clerk/nextjs`

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ **Route Protection**: All pages require authentication
- ✅ **Middleware**: Handles auth state server-side
- ✅ **Environment Security**: Keys stored in `.env.local` (not tracked)
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

## 🎨 UI Components Available

### For Unauthenticated Users:

- `<SignInButton>` - Opens sign-in modal
- `<SignUpButton>` - Opens sign-up modal

### For Authenticated Users:

- `<UserButton>` - User avatar with dropdown menu
- `<SignedIn>` - Shows content only when signed in
- `<SignedOut>` - Shows content only when signed out

### Hooks Available:

- `useAuth()` - Get authentication state
- `useUser()` - Get current user data
- `useClerk()` - Access Clerk instance

## 🛠️ Integration with Your Existing Features

Your existing features will now work with Clerk users:

- **Agent Builder**: Each user will have their own agent configurations
- **VAPI Integration**: Voice calls will be associated with authenticated users
- **Calendar Integration**: Microsoft Calendar will be linked to Clerk user accounts
- **Multi-user Support**: Perfect for your 100+ user CRM

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you see "Authentication Required" screen:

1. Check your Clerk keys in `.env.local`
2. Restart your dev server: `pnpm dev`
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### If sign-in doesn't work:

1. Verify keys are correct in Clerk Dashboard
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure `.env.local` is in your project root

### If you want to disable auth temporarily:

Comment out the `<ProtectedRoute>` wrapper in `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
<Providers>
  {/* <ProtectedRoute> */}
  <Navigation />
  <main>{children}</main>
  {/* </ProtectedRoute> */}
</Providers>
```

## 🎉 You're All Set!
