# Agent Builder UI Improvements - Completed âœ…

## What Was Enhanced

### 1. **System Prompt Editor - MUCH LARGER**

- Changed from `rows={6}` to `rows={20}` (3x bigger!)
- Added `font-mono` class for better code readability
- Now the main editing area as it should be

### 2. **Click-to-Insert Variable Chips**

When you have variables defined, you'll see blue chips above the System Prompt:

```
ðŸ“Œ Click a variable to insert it into your prompt:
[+ Property Address] [+ User Email] [+ Phone Number]
```

**Click any chip** and it automatically inserts formatted text like:

```
**Property Address** (property_address):
The address of the property to view
REQUIRED - You must collect this before proceeding.
```

### 3. **VAPI Tips Guide**

Added helpful tips box below the prompt editor explaining:

- How VAPI extracts variables from conversation
- When to mark fields as required vs optional
- How to tell the AI when to call functions
- Natural language instruction style

### 4. **Better Placeholders & Labels**

- System Prompt: "e.g., You are a helpful real estate assistant..."
- First Message: "e.g., Hi! I'm here to help you book a property viewing..."
- Clear labels: "System Prompt (Main Instructions)", "First Message (Greeting)"

### 5. **All Backend URLs Use `.env`**

Verified all code uses `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`:

- âœ… VAPI agent page: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- âœ… VAPI config (webhooks): `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL + '/vapi/webhook'`
- âœ… Calendar actions: Uses environment variable
- âœ… All API clients: Centralized config

## How Variables Work in VAPI

### VAPI's Variable Extraction (Automatic)

VAPI's AI automatically extracts information from conversations. You DON'T need special syntax like `{{variable}}`.

**Instead, write natural instructions:**

```
You are a real estate assistant. Your goal is to book property viewings.

You MUST collect the following information:

**Property Address** (property_address):
The full street address of the property they want to view.
REQUIRED - You must collect this before booking.

**User Email** (user_email):
Their email address for confirmation.
REQUIRED

**Preferred Date** (preferred_date):
When they'd like to visit (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
OPTIONAL - If not provided, suggest the next 3 available days.

Once you have collected property_address and user_email, call the set_appointment function.
```

### Function Calling

When VAPI sees your function definitions (with parameters matching your variables), it automatically:

1. Extracts the values from the conversation
2. Calls your function with those parameters
3. Sends the request to your webhook (`/vapi/webhook`)

### Example Flow:

1. **User says**: "I want to see 123 Main St tomorrow, my email is john@example.com"
2. **VAPI extracts**:
   - `property_address`: "123 Main St"
   - `user_email`: "john@example.com"
   - `preferred_date`: "2025-01-22"
3. **VAPI calls**: `set_appointment(property_address="123 Main St", user_email="john@example.com", ...)`
4. **Your backend receives**: POST `/vapi/webhook` with those parameters
5. **Your backend**: Books the appointment in Microsoft Calendar
6. **VAPI continues**: "Great! I've booked your viewing for 123 Main St tomorrow..."

## Environment Configuration

### Current `.env.local`:

```bash
# Backend API URL (Production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://peterental-vapi-github-newer.onrender.com

# VAPI Integration
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=d8eb6604-8c1d-4cfa-ae55-c92f7304d1d4

# VAPI API Key (for programmatic assistant management)
VAPI_API_KEY=d180ee70-5c20-4d9a-af4f-97f9e1d8957d

# Default user (will be dynamic from context)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_USER_ID=mark@peterei.com

# Environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

âœ… **All correct and using production backend!**

## Testing Checklist

### Agent Builder:

- [x] URL encoding fix (decodeURIComponent)
- [x] Large system prompt editor (20 rows)
- [x] Click-to-insert variable chips
- [x] VAPI tips guide
- [ ] Test: Add variables and insert them into prompt
- [ ] Test: Preview generated VAPI config
- [ ] Test: Sync to VAPI Dashboard
- [ ] Test: Import existing assistant

### VAPI Agent Page:

## Next Steps

1. **Test Variable Insertion**

   - Go to Agent Builder
   - Add a variable (e.g., "Property Address")
   - Click the chip to insert it into the prompt
   - Verify it formats correctly

2. **Preview VAPI Config**

   - Click "Preview VAPI Config" tab
   - Verify it generates proper function definitions
   - Check system prompt includes variable instructions

3. **Sync to VAPI**

   - Click "Sync to VAPI" button
   - Should create/update assistant in VAPI Dashboard
   - Check for success message

4. **Test Voice Call**
   - Go to Voice AI page
   - Select your synced assistant
   - Start call and test variable collection
