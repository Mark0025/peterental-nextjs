## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Recommended: UI Mode (Visual Testing)
```bash
# Opens interactive UI to run tests
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Step through tests with debugging
pnpm test:e2e:debug
```

### Specific Test File
```bash
# Run only authentication tests
pnpx playwright test tests/e2e/01-authentication.spec.ts

# Run only calendar tests
pnpx playwright test tests/e2e/02-user-profile-calendar.spec.ts
```

### View Test Report
```bash
# After running tests, view HTML report
pnpm test:e2e:report
```

## 📊 Expected Results

**Total Tests:** ~29
**Expected Duration:** 60-75 seconds
**Test User:** mark@localhousebuyers.net

### What Should Pass
- ✅ All authentication flows
- ✅ User profile displays correct email
- ✅ Calendar status shows for your account
- ✅ Dashboard loads rental data
- ✅ No hardcoded values in logs
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation works

### What Might Be Skipped
- ⚠️ Calendar disconnect test (if calendar not connected)
- ⚠️ Property details test (if no rentals in database)

These tests will gracefully skip if conditions aren't met.

## 🔒 Security Features

### Credential Safety
- ✅ Credentials stored in `.env.test` (gitignored)
- ✅ Never committed to repository
- ✅ Test user isolated from production data
- ✅ All requests use Clerk JWT authentication

### What's NOT Tested
- ❌ Password reset flows (requires email access)
- ❌ OAuth callback flows (requires Microsoft OAuth consent)
- ❌ Payment processing (not implemented)
- ❌ Admin-only features (requires admin account)

---

## 📸 Test Artifacts

When tests run, they generate:
- **Screenshots**: On failure only
- **Videos**: On failure only
- **Traces**: On first retry
- **HTML Report**: Always generated

All artifacts saved to:
```
test-results/          # Individual test results
playwright-report/     # HTML report
```

Both directories are gitignored.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests fail with "timeout"
**Solution:** Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`

### Tests fail with "browser not found"
**Solution:** Run `pnpx playwright install chromium`

### Clerk sign-in fails
**Solution:**
1. Verify credentials in `.env.test`
2. Check Clerk environment variables in `.env.local`
3. Ensure dev server is running on port 3000

### Backend API errors
**Solution:**
1. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct
2. Verify backend is accessible at https://peterentalvapi-latest.onrender.com
3. Check Clerk JWT tokens are being sent properly

### Tests pass locally but fail in CI
**Solution:**
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in CI
2. Check network access to backend from CI
3. Verify Clerk credentials work in CI environment

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Running Tests in Development
1. **Use UI mode** for interactive testing: `pnpm test:e2e:ui`
2. **Run specific tests** while developing features
3. **Check test reports** after failures
4. **Update tests** when UI changes

### Running Tests in CI
1. Set `CI=true` environment variable
2. Tests will automatically retry once on failure
3. HTML report will be generated
4. Screenshots/videos captured on failure

### Adding New Tests
1. Create new spec file: `tests/e2e/05-your-feature.spec.ts`
2. Import auth helper: `import { signIn } from './helpers/auth'`
3. Use test user from environment
4. Follow existing naming conventions
5. Run tests to verify: `pnpm test:e2e`
