# E2E Test Failure Analysis

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Test Run:** 29 tests executed, **29 failed** (100% failure rate)
**Root Cause:** Clerk authentication helper cannot find sign-in form

---

## üî¥ Critical Issue: Clerk Sign-In Detection

### Primary Error
```
TimeoutError: page.waitForSelector: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.
waiting for locator('input[name="identifier"], input[type="email"]') to be visible
```

**Location:** `tests/e2e/helpers/auth.ts:43`

### Why This Happened

The test helper expects Clerk to show a sign-in form when visiting the homepage, but one of these is likely true:

1. **User is already signed in** - Clerk maintains session cookies between test runs
2. **Clerk redirects differently** - Middleware may handle auth differently in test mode
3. **Sign-in button doesn't trigger form** - Clerk UI may use modal/popup instead
4. **Selector doesn't match** - Clerk UI elements have different attributes

### Affected Tests (All 29)

**Authentication Tests (6):**
- ‚úò should sign in with valid credentials
- ‚úò should access protected routes when authenticated
- ‚úò should sign out successfully
- ‚úò should redirect to sign-in for protected routes when not authenticated
- ‚úò should persist session across page reloads
- ‚úò should display correct user email in navigation

**User Profile & Calendar Tests (8):**
- ‚úò should display user profile page with correct email
- ‚úò should show calendar connection status
- ‚úò should display connected Microsoft account email if calendar is connected
- ‚úò should show disconnect button when calendar is connected
- ‚úò should show connect button when calendar is not connected
- ‚úò should open confirmation dialog when clicking disconnect
- ‚úò should display user profile information
- ‚úò should load without errors

**Dashboard & Rentals Tests (8):**
- ‚úò should load dashboard page
- ‚úò should display rental statistics
- ‚úò should display rental property listings
- ‚úò should show loading state while fetching data
- ‚úò should display property details when available
- ‚úò should handle empty state if no rentals
- ‚úò should navigate back to home from dashboard
- ‚úò should load without console errors

**Multi-Tenant Tests (7):**
- ‚úò should display correct user email in profile
- ‚úò should not show admin badge for non-admin users
- ‚úò should use Clerk authentication for all requests
- ‚úò should not have hardcoded user IDs in console logs
- ‚úò should show user-specific calendar connection
- ‚úò should handle multiple sessions correctly
- ‚úò should display correct data after page refresh

## üîß Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Update Auth Helper for Existing Session

**Problem:** Tests assume user needs to sign in, but Clerk session persists

**Solution:** Check if already signed in before attempting login

```typescript
// tests/e2e/helpers/auth.ts
export async function signIn(page: Page, user: TestUser) {
  // Check if already signed in
  const userButton = page.locator('[data-testid="user-button"], .cl-userButtonTrigger')
  const isSignedIn = await userButton.isVisible().catch(() => false)

  if (isSignedIn) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Already signed in - reusing session')
    return
  }

  // Continue with sign-in flow...
}
```

### Fix 2: Clear Cookies Between Test Runs

**Problem:** Clerk cookies persist across tests

**Solution:** Clear storage before each test suite

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
use: {
  storageState: undefined, // Don't reuse storage
  // OR clear before each test
}

// In test setup
test.beforeEach(async ({ context }) => {
  await context.clearCookies()
})
```

### Fix 3: Use Clerk's Test Mode

**Problem:** Production Clerk UI may not work well for E2E tests

**Solution:** Configure Clerk for test environment

```typescript
// Set up test-specific Clerk configuration
// Or use Clerk's testing utilities
```

### Fix 4: Take Screenshot to Debug

**Problem:** We don't know what's actually on the page

**Action:** View one of the failure screenshots:

```bash
open test-results/01-authentication-Authenti-6af99-n-in-with-valid-credentials-chromium/test-failed-1.png
```

This will show exactly what the page looks like when test fails.

## üêõ GitHub Issues to Create

### Issue #1: E2E Tests Failing - Clerk Authentication Helper

**Priority:** P0 (Blocking all E2E tests)

**Title:** E2E tests cannot detect Clerk sign-in form

**Description:**
```
All 29 E2E tests are failing because the authentication helper cannot find Clerk's sign-in form.

**Error:**
TimeoutError: page.waitForSelector: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.
waiting for locator('input[name="identifier"], input[type="email"]') to be visible

**Root Cause:**
The helper assumes Clerk will show a sign-in form, but either:
1. User is already signed in (cookies persist)
2. Clerk UI structure is different than expected
3. Sign-in flow uses modal/popup instead

**Affected:**
- All authentication tests (6)
- All profile tests (8)
- All dashboard tests (8)
- All multi-tenant tests (7)

**Evidence:**
- Test artifacts in: test-results/
- Full log: test-output.log

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Update auth helper to check for existing session first
2. Clear cookies between test runs
3. Use Clerk's test mode if available
4. Debug by viewing failure screenshots

**Steps to Reproduce:**
```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

**Impact:** Cannot run any E2E tests until resolved
```

### Issue #2: Need Clerk Test Configuration

**Priority:** P1 (Testing infrastructure)

**Title:** Configure Clerk for E2E testing environment

**Description:**
```
E2E tests need special Clerk configuration to work properly with Playwright.

**Requirements:**
- Predictable sign-in flow
- Ability to clear sessions between tests
- Test-specific auth tokens
- No rate limiting for test account

**Research Needed:**
- Does Clerk have a test mode?
- Can we use API tokens instead of UI?
- Should we mock Clerk for E2E tests?

**References:**
- Clerk Testing Docs: [link]
- Playwright Auth Docs: [link]
```

### Issue #3: Extract Screenshots to Debug Auth Flow

**Priority:** P2 (Investigation)

**Title:** Analyze Clerk UI from test failure screenshots

**Description:**
```
Review screenshots from failed tests to understand actual Clerk UI structure.

**Action Items:**
1. Open: test-results/01-authentication-Authenti-6af99.../test-failed-1.png
2. Document actual Clerk UI elements
3. Update selectors in auth helper
4. Test new selectors

**Goal:** Understand what page actually shows when tests run
```

---

## üìä Test Success Rate

**Current:** 0/29 (0%)
**Target:** 25/29 (86%) - Allow for some skips

**Blockers:**
1. Clerk authentication detection ‚Üê **MUST FIX**
2. After auth works, may find other issues

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **View a screenshot** to see what's actually on page:
   ```bash
   open test-results/01-authentication-Authenti-6af99-n-in-with-valid-credentials-chromium/test-failed-1.png
   ```

2. **Check if already signed in** by looking at screenshot for UserButton

3. **Update auth helper** based on findings:
   - Add check for existing session
   - Update selectors if needed
   - Add better error messages

4. **Clear test environment**:
   ```bash
   # Clear browser data
   rm -rf ~/.config/microsoft-edge/Default/
   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/
   ```

5. **Re-run tests** with updated helper:
   ```bash
   pnpm test:e2e
   ```

6. **Create GitHub issues** once we understand the problem

## üí° Learning: Clerk + Playwright Best Practices

**What We Learned:**
- Clerk sessions persist across Playwright runs
- Need to handle "already signed in" state
- Production auth UI may not match test expectations
- Screenshots are essential for debugging E2E failures

**Best Practices Going Forward:**
1. Always check for existing auth state first
2. Clear cookies/storage between test suites
3. Take screenshots on every navigation
4. Use data-testid attributes for stable selectors
5. Consider API-based auth for E2E (bypass UI)
