## 🏗️ Infrastructure Completed

### Backend Verification:
✅ `GET /agents` - Secure, user-scoped  
✅ `GET /database/available` - Rentals working  
✅ Dashboard stats - Frontend combines endpoints efficiently  

### New Utilities Created:
✅ **Dashboard API Client** (`src/lib/api/dashboard.ts`)
- Aggregates agents, rentals, calendar stats
- Parallel fetching (4 API calls → 1 function)
- User-scoped via JWT headers

✅ **Dashboard Server Actions** (`src/actions/dashboard-actions.ts`)
- `getDashboardStats()` - Full aggregation
- `getAgentCount()` - Quick agent count
- `getRentalCount()` - Quick rental count
- `isCalendarConnected()` - Calendar status check

### New Pages Created:
✅ `/calendar/events` - Calendar events & availability  
✅ `/rentals` - Rental search (user-scoped, filter ready)  
✅ `/admin/testing` - Admin testing interface  
✅ `/admin` - Admin hub
